# ARP Poisoning (also known as ARP Spoofing) is a type of cyber attack carried out over a Local Area Network (LAN)
# that involves sending malicious ARP packets to a default gateway on a LAN in order to change the pairings in
# its IP to MAC address table. ARP Protocol translates IP addresses into MAC addresses. Because the ARP protocol
# was designed purely for efficiency and not for security, ARP Poisoning attacks are extremely easy to carry out
# as long as the attacker has control of a machine within the target LAN or is directly connected to it.
